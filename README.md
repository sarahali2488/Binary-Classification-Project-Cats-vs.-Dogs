# Binary-Classification-Project-Cats-vs.-Dogs
This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using machine learning and deep learning techniques.  We explore two approaches: a Random Forest model for traditional machine learning and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for deep learning.
